# neural-networks
Source code for all of my personal projects focused on building neural networks

The modules/ directory is structured to mirror PyTorch's torch.nn, with the goal being concise and easy-to-read code. I've developed the code for all of these models using only NumPy in order to solidify my own understanding of the math behind back-propagation and develop fluency with neural network experiments.

alpha: 0.1
success rate on test set: 9.8%
backprop: SGD
epochs: 1
dataset: MNIST, training set
batch size: 1

notes: very inaccurate, and highly unpredictable loss. Model does not seem to
        learn very well from the training dataset

the plot itself only goes up until 14,000 iterations on the x-axis because the
values after are all considered NaN and therefore matplotlib can't plot it

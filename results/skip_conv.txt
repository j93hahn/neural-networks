Note: Biases are all initialized to 0; weights are initialized using corresponding technique

Only 1 epoch of training applied here --

Freeze all Conv layers

losses1: normal initialization, 0.3283
losses2: uniform initialization, 0.9000
losses3: xavier normal initialization, 0.6342
losses4: xavier uniform initialization, 0.5210

Freeze all Linear layers

lossesA: normal initialization,
lossesB: uniform initialization,
